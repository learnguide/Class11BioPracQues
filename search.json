He gave two names to a species eg. Mangifere is generic name and indica is the specific name. Binomial nomenclature is universally accepted all over the world because it is written according to universal rules of nomenclature framed by ICBN, ICZN, & ICNPC etc. It has two parts generic name & specific name followed by name if scientist who discovered it at last in abbreviated form. It must be in Latin or derived from Latin. It must be binomial. The genus starts with capital letter while species by small letter. Handwritten name is underlined it indicates relationship with other species present in same genus. The rules & regulations present of binomial nomenclature must be observed before a taxonomist names a new found organism.

Reproduction in algae occurs by the following method:-(i) Vegetative reproduction:- It occurs by fragmentation, zoospores, aplanospares palmella stages etc. akinites are also formed in asexual reproduction. (ii) Sexual Reproduotion in chlamydomonas:- In chlamydomonas, the flagellated & motile gametes which are isogamous unite to form a quadriflagellate zygote. It is converted into zygospore. When the flagella are lost & a cyst wall is formed around it zygospore germinate by meiosis to form four haploid meiospores. (iii) Palmella stage:- If the conditions are unfavourable, the daughter cells instead of forming zoospore divided repeatedly into numerous cells. Their walls become gelatinous & cells remains together. This stage is called palmella stage. On return of favourable conditions, the cells inside the gelatinous mass & develop cilia. (iv) Asexual Reproduction in chlamydomonas:- It takes place by formation of zoospores In the formation of zoospores, the cilia from chlamydomonas are withdrawn. The cell content divide into 4 & 8 daughter cells. In this way, they become motile & called as zoospores. 13.What are ferns? Describe its salient features. Ans. Ferns are found in warm moist tropical region & dry rocky places. The plant body is distinguished into three parts- i) underground stem rhizome ii) it bear roots & iii) it sends caerial shoots with leaves. Leaves of ferns are of two types- a) simple leaves with single vein & b) compound leaves with several leaflets. The sporophyte phase is dominant in ferns. On underside of leaflets are borne sori which contains sporangia. Where the spores are produced after meiosis division, the sporangium has an annulus. It is made of band of thickened cells that dry out pulling it open. So spores are released. These spores germinate into a porthallus the gametophyte. The gametophyte bears antheridia & archaegmia on underside. The antheridia bear flagellated sperms & egg lies at the base of archaegonia. The process of fertilization occurs when water is available for flagellated sperms to swim to reach the egg. 14.Differentiate between Red, Brown & Green algae. 15 ","Ans.

Ans. There are three types of life cycle are found in green algae:-(a) HAPLONTIC LIFE CYCLE:- The dominant phase is haploid. Diploid state is found only in the form of zygote or zygospores. Meiosis takes place at time of its germination. Eg. ulothrix, spirogyra. (b) DIPLONTIC LIFE CYCLE:- The dominant phase alga is diploid. It gives rise to haploid gametes through meiosis. Gametes unit & the zygote regenerates diploid phase. (c) DIPLOHAPLONTIC LIFE CYCLE:- It has well developed multicellular haploid & diploid phase. These are respectively called gametophyte & sporophyte. Haploid gametophyte produce haploid gametes. Fusion product of gametes grows directly into diploid sporophytes. Sporophytes produce haploid spores by meiosis. The meiospores germinate into new gametophyte. 17 ","2. Explain briefly the alternation of generation in bryophytes? Ans. The life cycle of moss represesents two distinct generations GAMETOPHYTIC & SPOROPHYTIC. Moss plant is a gametophyte. Spore is the beginning of gametophytic generation. It develops into protenema which give rise to male & female gametophytes. Gametophyte consists of green thallus having archegoniophores & antheridiophores which bear sex organs & the gametes are produced in them either monoecious or diecious. Club shaped antheriduim bears biflagellate sperms or antherozoids. Flask shaped archegonium encloses the female egg. Zygote is formed after the fertilization of male & female gametes with the help of water. Repeated divisions of the zygote give rise to the embryo (2N) which soon develops into sporophyte. The sporophyte of moss gets differenliated into three parts foot seta & capsule. Inside the capsule single celled spores are produced. After the dehiscence, they begin to germinate & give rise to protonema to start the cycle again. Gametophytic Generation alternates the sporophytic generation. 18 ","3.Describe the common mode of reproduction in Angiosperms. Ans. Stamens & pistils are the two reproductive parts of a flower. The stamen consist of a slender filament with anthers at the tip. Each pistil is made of three parts- ovary, style & stigma. Ovary contains one to many ovules. Each ovule contains megaspore mother cell it produces four haploid megaspores after meiosis of them three degenerate & remaining one is functional megaspore. It divides by meiosis forming megagametophyte. It consists of 8 haploid nuclei embedded in cytoplasm of which 3 cells lie at the micropylar end & 3 antipodal lie at chalazal end. The two remaining nuclei move to centre to make a diploid nucleus. The anthers have pollen sac & contains many microspore mother cells. Each of them produces four haploid microspores after meiosis & each becomes a microgametophyte. It contains two nuclei generative nucleus & tube nucleus. The pouen iscarried away by air & other agencies & reaches stigma of pistil of same or difference plants. This process is called pollination. Pollen grains germinates & produces a pollen tube it grows within style & reaches ovule of ovary. The generative nucleus divides pollen tube producing two male gametes. On reaching ovule, pollen tube burst to release male gamtes. One of the two gametes fertilise egg & forms a diploid zygote. Other male gamete fertilizes with polar nuclei to form triploid endosperm. This is known as double fertilization. 19 ","4.Classify plant kingdom?

The blood consists of two parts- plasma (liquid part) & corpuscles (solid parts). The blood corpuscles float in the plasma & are of three major types:-(a) Red Blood cells or Erythrocytes:- They are circular disc–shaped biconcave cells without nucleus. They contains a pigment haemoglobin which has great affinity towards oxygen. In normal healthy individuals, the number of RBCs / mm 3 ranges between 4.5-5 millions in females & 5.5-6.0 millions in males. (b) White Blood cells or Leucocytes :- These are colourless nucleated corpuscles & can pass through the capillary walls into lymph & tissue fluid. Their count is 6000 to 10,000 per mm 3 of blood. Their main function is protection against any foreign substance. Leucocytes are further of two types:-(i)AGRANULOCYTES:-They have clear cytoplasm without granules & a bilobed nucleus they are further divided into two types lymphocytes & monocytes. (ii) GRANULOCYTES:-They are of three main types Basophils :- which are stained with basic dye (methylene blue) & have a bilobed nucleus. Neutrophils:- which are stained with neutral dye & have multilobed nucleus. 12 ","Eosinophils :- which are stained with acidic dye (eosin) & have bilobed nucleus. 4.How do erytherocytes transport oxygen & carbon dioxide in the blood? Ans. During development of erythrocytes there is formation of special substance called haemoglobin which is capable of transporting oxygen. It is a complex protein & is composed of two components a) a protein called globin & b) a Fe 2+ porphyrin ring called heme. This haemoglobin when exposed to high partial pressure of oxygen combines with oxygem to form oxy-haemoglobin which carries 4 molecules of oxygen loosely bound to four Fe 2+ ions. When this oxy haemoglobin reaches the tissues where there is low oxygen pressure oxyhaemoglobin dissociates into oxygen & deoxyhaemoglobin. In this way, erythrocytes transports oxygen from lungs to tissue. Similarly haemoglobin also transports carbon dioxide from tissues to lungs. 5.Describe the different types of connective tissues & give examples? Ans. On the Basis of matrix, connective tissues are of two main types:-(I) Connective tissue proper:- It connects & supports many tissues & organs. Its matrix is dense. Eg.

Fiborblasts are irregularly shaped flat cells with long protoplasmic processes, they secrete collagen & elastin proteins for the fibres. (ii) Adipose tissue:- It consists of collagen fibres, elastin fibres, fibroblast, maerophages, & adipocytes which stores fat. It prevents heat loss by forming one insulating layer beneath skin. (II) Supportive connective tissues :- It consists of following types of connective tissue:-(i) Cartilage:- It is the endoskeletal material of the vertebrates, it is in the form of solid matrix formed of chondrin with few collagen fibres & chondrioblast cells. (ii) Bone:- The matrix consists of bone cells, osteocytes, fibres & a ground substance impregnated by calcium phosphate, calcium carbonate, magnesium phosphate & calcium 13 ","fluoride.

A voluntary muscle is a bundle of numerous striated muscle fibres. Each fibres is long, unbranched measuring 40 mm in length & 20ym in thickness. Each fibre is enclosed in a membrane called sarcolemma & its cytoplasm is called sarcoplasm. The sarcoplasm contains many myofibrils that are long, thin, unbranched & cross striated. Each myofibril consists of alternating thick A & light I-band. A band is formed of protein myosin & I-band with actin protein. The thick filament bands lie parallel to one another. The thin filament extends between them upto a considerable distance in an orderly manner. At the center of the I-band is a fine, dense, dark, Z-line. Each segment of myofibril from one Z-band to the next functions as a contractile unit & is called sarcomere. 7.How does blood gets coagulated on coming out from an injured vessel. How coagulation is normally prevented uninjured vessels. Ans. When a blood vessel is injured & blood comes out of it, the thrombocytes clump together, break & release the coagulation promoting substances called thromboplastin. Thromboplastin helps in the formation of enzyme thrombokinase. This enzyme thrombokinase hydrolyses prothrombin in the plasma into thrombin ca 2+ ions are needed for both activation & functioning of thrombin. Thrombin catalyses the hydrolysis of soluble fibrinogen in the plasma into insoluble fibrin. The fibrin precipitates as a network of fibres & traps many blood cells to form a red solid mass called blood clot. The clot seals the wound in the blood vessel to stop bleeding. However in uninjured tissues & blood vessels don’t release thromboplastin. That’s why coagulation is prevented in an uninjured vessel. 8.Name the various fibres of connective tissue & compare them.

Ans. A chemical that is converted into a product is known as the substrate. Therefore the enzymes with tertiary structures including an active site convert a substrate into a product. The substrate ‘S’ must bind enzymes at its active site within a given cleft. So an obligatory formation of an ES substrate complex occurs. At a state when the substrate is bound to an enzyme active site, a new structure of substrate is formed. In the graph, if ‘P’ is at lower level than ‘S’ reaction is exothermic i-e energy is supplied to make product ‘P’. The ‘S’ has to go through much higher energy state known as “transition state.

Facilitated diffusion is also called carrier mediated diffusion or transport by carrier proteins. It occurs along the concentration gradient assisted by carrier proteins eg. diffusion of glucose in RBC’s. The membrane provides sites at which some molecules cross the membrane. They do not set up a concentration gradient. A concentration gradient is present for molecules to diffuse even if facilitated by proteins membrane without expenditure of ATP energy. It cannot cause net transport of molecules from a low to high concentration as it requires input of energy. Transport rate reaches maximum when all of the protein transporters are being used. It is very specific & permits a cell to select with protein side chains. Facilitated diffusion is stereo specific the carrier proteins are permeases. 4.Describe water potential?

It is denoted by psi or .Water potential is the chemical energy of water. It is measured in terms of pressure & is also influenced by concentration gravity as well as pressure. The chemical potential of water is called water potential. It indicates free energy rotated to water. Water potential of pure water is zero. Water moves into the cell from outside & hydrostatic pressure is increased. It increases water potential of a solute but the difference between inside & outside is reduced. Water moves from outside into the cell due to water potential gradient. Three factors affect water potential. They are matric potential , solute potential & pressure potential . Solute potential is always negative. Pressure potential is usually positive & is denoted by . Thus, water potential is affected by both solute & pressure potential.

Ans. Cohesive force theory or transpirational pull theory was proposed by Dixon & jolly. Main aspects of this theory are:-i) Strong cohesive force or tensile strength of water:- The water molecules attract each other by mutual force which is called the “cohesive force”. The attraction between the walls of xylem elements & the water molecules is called adhesion the cohesive force helps to maintain a long column of water under tension. ii) Continuity of water column in plant:- air breaks do not hinders the total cohesive system & the tree are able to maintain a rapid flow of sap. The water or the sap can be pulled by the transpiration force. iii)Transpiration pull or tension of unbroken column of water:- As a result of transpiration water is drawn in the intercellular spaces from the mesophyll cells which consequently draw water osmotically from nearby cells & thus a diffusion pressure deficit or suction force is developed. Due to suction force, the adjacent cells take water from xylem of these veins of the leaves. As the xylem of these veins is connected with xylem of roots through stem xylem a tension is set up in the water column of xylem & whole column is physically pulled up. 2.What forces are involved in absorption of water from soil by root hairs. Ans. a) A negative tension is exerted down the roots due to transpiration on pull by the aerial parts of the plants this causes a decrease in water potential of roots which favours the uptake of water from the soil. b) The decrease of water potential in the root cells than the soil favours the absorption of 13 ","water from the soil. c) The cohesive forces among the water molecules & adhesive forces between the water & xylem vessels maintain an unbroken column of water in capillaries of xylem vessels. The gradient of water potential exists in the xylem vessel starting from leaf to roots which favour uptake of water from the soil. d) The water from the soil enters into the root hairs & from there it reaches the xylem vessel with lower water potential. It results in formation of root pressure. This root pressure pushes water to aerial parts of plant body. 3.Define transpiration? Why is it useful?

Explain -There is no oxygen evolution in bacterial photosynthesis. Ans. In bacterial photosynthesis, the raw material for the supply of proton is H 2 S than H 2 O Thus, these is production of S than O 2 during splitting in light reaction. 2H 2 S → 2HS + + 2H + HS + HS → H 2 S+S 2. What is the advantage of using chlorella rather than a higher plant? Ans. Photosynthesis in chlorella and higher plants is biochemically similar but chlorella was used by Melvin Calvin (1954) due to following reasons – (i) Chlorella culture is a chloroplast culture as a large volume of every cell is occupied by a single chloroplast. (ii) A synchroneous culture may easily be obtained in a short span of time. (iii) Cells are very quickly exposed to radioactive carbondioxcide and are quickly killed; thus handling chlorella for experiments is easier. 3. What is the advantage of having more than one pigment molecule in a photo centre? Ans. Light reaction depends upon the amount of solar energy trapped by the pigment. Energy trapped by a single pigment molecule is not enough to start the initial reaction which may occur in light. Hence, a number of pigment molecules provide protection to the chlorophyll molecule against photo oxidation. 8 ","4. Why are C 4 plant preferred in the tropical region? Ans. C 4 plants utilize 30 ATP’s to produce one molecule of glucose favoured in tropical region. In these plants photorespiration is the mechanism not to lose the photosynthetic carbon. In the process of photorespiration RuBP is catabolised to a 3-carbon atom compound instead of combining with CO 2 . More than 50% CO 2 fixed by photosynthesis is lost in photorespiration. Photorespiration acts to undo the work of photosynthesis as no energy rich compound is produced during this process. Thus C 4 plants are better photosynthesizes than C 3 plants and C 4 pathway is of adaptive advantage in tropical region and thus these plants are preferred. 5.

It occurs in some organisms like some bacteria that produce lactic acid from pyruvic acid. In animal cells, such as muscles during exercise, when O 2 is inadequate for cellular exercise, the pyruvic acid is reduced to lactic acid by lactate dehydrogrogenase. Reducing agent is NADH + H + that is reoxidised to NAD + in both processes. 10 ","In both lactic acid and alcohol fermentation not much energy is relased; less than seven per cent of the energy in glucose is released and not all it is trapped as high energy bonds of ATP. The processes are hazardous either the acid or alcohol is produced. Yeasts poison themselves to death when the concentration of alcohol reaches approximately 13%. 11 ","CBSE Class 12 Biology Important Questions Chapter 14 Respiration in Plants 5 Marks Questions 1.Describe the process and role of citric acid cycle in living organisms. Ans. It is called “tricarboxylic acid cycle”. Following steps are present for completing this cycle-(i) In this step, CO 2 is removed from pyruvic acid and resulting 2- carbon unit with the sulphur containing compound coenzyme A forming Acetyl CoA. During this process the hydrogen released is accepted by NAD and NADH 2 is produced. Pyruvic acid _ CoA + NAD → Acetyl CoA + NADH2 + CO 2 (ii) Acetyl coenzyme A reacts with a 4 – carbon compound oxaloacetic acid to form citric acid. (iii) The citrate remains in equilibrium with cisaconitic acid and isocitric acid in the presence of the enzyme aconitase. Citric acid → Isocitric acid. (iv) Isocitrate is dehydrogenated in the presence of isocitrate dehydrogenase enzyme to form oxalosuccinate. The hydrogen released is accepted by NAD to form NADH 2 . Isocitric acid + NAD → Oxalosuccinate + NADH 2 . (v) A molecule of CO 2 is lost from oxalosuccinate and a 5 – carbon compound – ketoglutaric acid is formed in the presence of decarboxylate enzyme. (vi) – ketoglutarate loses a molecule of CO 2 and 4 – carbon compound succinyl CoA is formed. 12 ","– keloglutarate + CoA + NAD → succinyl + CoA + NADH 2 + CO 2 (vii) Succinyl CoA forms succinate, and ATP is found by linking ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi) Succinate CoA + ADP + Pi → Succinylate + CoA + ATP b Succinate is oxidized into fumarate in the presence of succinate dehydrogenase enzyme. The hydrogen liberated is accepted by FAD and FADH 2 is formed. Succinate + FAD → Fumerate + FADH 2 (ix) In this step the fumarate is converted into malate in the presence of enzyme fumarate hydrase (fumarase) Fumarate → Malate. (x) Malate is changed into oxaloacetate in the presence of the enzyme malate denydrogenase. NAD is reduced to NADH 2 by the liberated hydrogen. Thus oxaloacetic acid produced is ready to combine with the fresh acetyl CoA obtained from pyruvic acid for completing one cycle. Net yield kreb’s cycle :- 1 Pyruvic acid + 1ADP + 4NAD + 1FAD à3CO 2 + 1FADH 2 + 4NADH 2 + 1ATP Thus total yield of energy 1ATP = 1 ATP 3×4NADH2 = 12ATP 2×1FADH2 = 2ATP Total = 15 ATP Thus 2 Pyruvic acid in ghycolysis yield, 15×2=30ATP. 2..Explain ETS. 13 ","Ans. Mechanism of Electron transport system – Glucose molecule is completely oxidized by the end of the citric acid cycle. The energy is not released unless NADH and FADH are oxidized through the ETS. The oxidation means ‘removal of electrons from it’. Metabolic pathway through which the electron passes from one carrier to another is called “Electron transport system” It is operative in the inner mitochondria membrane. Electrons from NADH produced in mitochondrial matrix are oxidized by NADH dehydrogenase (complex I) and electrons are then transferred to ubiqinone located within the inner membrane also receives reducing equivalents via FADH; that is generated during oxidation of succinate, through activity of enzyme named succinate dehydrogenase (complex II). Reduced ubiquinone is then oxidized with the transfer of electrons to cytochrome complex (complex III). Cytothrome is small protein attached to outer surface of inner membrane and acts as a mobile carries for transfer of electrons between complex III and complex IV. (complex IV) is cytochromes ‘c’ oxidize complex having cytochromes ‘a’ and a 3 . When electron pass from one carries to another via complex I to IV in ETS, they are coupled to ATP synthase (complex V) for production ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate. Oxidation of one molecule of NADH, gives rise to 3 molecules of ATP, while that of FADH, produces 2 molecules of ATP. Electrons are curried by cytochromes and recombine with their protons before the final stage when hydrogen atom is accepted by oxygen to form water. O 2 acts as final hydrogen acceptor. Whole process by which oxygen allows the production of ATP by phosphorylation of ADP is called ‘oxidative phosphorylation’. 3.Give the various steps involved in Glycolysis. Ans. The steps are as follows-1) Glucose is phosphorylated in the presence of ATP, catalyzed by the enzyme hexokinase. 2) Glucose – 6 – phosphate is changed into its isomer fructose – 6 – phosphate catalyzed by phosphohexose isomers. 3) Fructose – 6 – phosphate is phosphorylated in the presence of ATP to form Fructose 1, 6 biphosphate. 4) Fructose 1, 6 biposphate is split into two molecules of triose phosphate one of 3 – 14 ","phosphoglyceral dehyde and one of dihydroxyacetose phosphate, which are interconvertible. This reaction is catalysed by phosphofructokinase. 5) 3 – phosphoglyceraldehyde is oxieised to 1,3 biphosphoglycerate, with the reduction of NAD to NADH. 6) Phosphoglycerate kinase catalyses the formation of 3-phosphoglycerate to 1,3 biposphoglycerate and 1 molecule of ATP is produced directly (substrate phosphation). 7) 3-phosphoglycerate is converted into 2-phosphoglycerate and then into phosphoenlpysuvate (PEP) 8) PEP is converted into pyrucate long with the formation of one molecule of ATP directly. The enzyme pyruvate kinase catalyses this step. The end products of glycolysis are 2 molecules of pyruvc acid + 2 NADH + 2ATP. 15 ","CBSE Class 11 Biology Important Questions Chapter 15 Plant Growth and Development 1 Marks Questions 1.What is growth?

These plants require a relatively short day light period usually 8-10 hours and a continous dark period of about 14-16 hours for flowering. In short day plants dark period is critical and must be continuous. They are known as long Night plants and the term short day plant is a misnomer with long night plants. 7. Explain the role played by phytohormone in seed germination. Ans. It is a regulatory pigment which controls several light dependent developmental processes in plants besides seed germination. Phytohormones exist in two inter convertible forms : Pr and P fr . On absorbing red light Pr becomes P fr and P fr becomes P r either rapidly by absorbing far red light or slowly in darkness. Germination is promoted by P fr and red light is needed to promote this. Darkness (far-red) promotes P r formation which induces dormancy and inhibits germination. 8.What is ‘Bioassay’? Ans.

Ans. • Premature fall of leaf and fruit is called abscission. * Abscisic acid 6 ","CBSE Class 12 Biology Important Questions Chapter 15 Plant Growth and Development 3 Marks Questions 1.What are the conditions necessary for growth? Ans. The necessary conditions for growth are water, oxygen and nutrients. The plant cell grows in size by cell enlargement that needs water. The plant growth and further development are intimately liked to water status of plants. Water provides medium for enzymatic activities needed for growth O 2 helps in releasing metabolic energy for growth. Nutrients both macro and micro essential elements are needed by plants for synthesis of the protoplasm. Moreover, they act as source of energy. Every plant has an optimum temperature range best suited for its growth. Any deviation from it may be detrimental to its survival. Environmental signal like light and gravity also influence various phases or stages of growth in plaints. 2.What does the sigmoid growth curve of a population mean? Ans. In biological organization growth occurs at many levels, from the molecular level upto the ecosystem level. It can be measured at different levels such as the growth of cell organism or population. If it is measured in length, area, volume, mass or number of cells or individuals and plotted against time, and s-shaped curve is obtained. This is known as sigmoid curve. An analysis of this curve shows a lag phase during which slow growth occurs. This gradually attains a rapid growth, followed by a period of slow growth and ultimately a decline called stationary phase. Since the same patterns of growth is sigmoid curve observed at all levels of organization it is said to be universal. 3.Differentiate between photoperiodism and vernilisation? Ans. 7 ","Photoperiodism Vernilization a Photoperiodism is the flowering response of the plants to the duration of light and dark period in the diurnal cycle. Vernalisation prepares the plants for perceiving stimulus for flower induction by chilling treatment. b In this stimulus perceived by green leaves only. Stimulus is perceived by young embryos, meristems and even leaves. c In this florigen is produced under photoinductive conditions. Vernalin is produced by chilling treatment. d Photoperiodic induction cannot be reversed by exposing to non-inductive conditions. Vernalisation can be reversed when maintained higher temperature e GA3 has the capability to replace the requirements of photo-inductive conditions in long day plants only. GA3 can replace cold treatment to induce vernalisation. 4.Discuss the statement : ‘The growth is measurable’ Ans. The growth (at a cellular level) is basically a consequence of increase in the amount of protoplasm. Since we cannot measure growth directly it is measured by some quantity that is more or less proportional to it so the growth is measured by a variety of parameters like increase in fresh weight; dry weight; length; area; volume and cell number etc. One single maize root apical meristem may give rise to more than 17,500 new calls per hour. The cells in a watermelon can increase in size by upto 3,50,000 times. Therefore, growth may be expressed as increase in cell number or as increase in size of cell. The growth of a pollen tube is measured in terms of length. An increase in surface area measures growth in a dorsiventral leaf or dicot leaf. 5.What is apical dominance name the hormone that controls it. Ans. “The inhibition of growth of lateral buds into the branches in the presence of an apical bud.” 8 ","Apical dominance is under the control of auxins IAA (indole acctic acid) is the principal auxin found in all the plants. Lateral buds start their development when apical bud is removed. The process is again reversed if you apply IAA to decapitulate apex of plant. 6.Write the principal characteristics of PGR’s. Ans.

Explain the absorption of digested products. Ans. Absorption of Digested products – The absorption is defined “as the process by which end products of digestion pass through the intestinal mucosa onto the blood or lymph” . The process of absorption is carried out by 3 mechanisms: by passive, active or transport mechanisms. The monosaceharides such as glucose, amino acids and certain electrolytes e.g. chloride are mostly absorbed by the process of simple diffusion against the concentration gradient some substances e.g., fructose and some amino acids are absorbed the help of carries ions like Na + . It is known as facilitated transport. The transport of water – It depends upon osmotic gradient. Active transport takes place against the concentration gradient and it needs energy. The amino acids, monosaccharides like Glucose, electrolytes like Na+ are absorbed into the blood by active transport. The fatty acids and glycerol – These are insoluble and so cannot be absorbed into blood. They are incorporated into small droplets termed as micelles. They move into the intestinal mucosa. They again form very small protein – coated fat globules or the chylomicrons. The chylomicrons are transported into lymph vessel or lacteals found in the villi. They ultimately release absorbed substances into the blood. The absorption of various substances occurs in various parts of alimentary canal, mouth, stomach, small intestine and large intestine.

Represents maximum total amount of air which can be present in lungs after maximum inspiratory effort. 4.Explain the mechanism of breathing in humans. Ans. The mechanism of breathing in human involves breathing in of air in the lungs and breathing out of air from lungs thoracic cavity. The form is called inspiration and later expiration. The lungs are located in the closed thoracic cavity. A muscular partition called diaphragm separates the thoracic cavity from the abdominal cavity. During inspiration the diaphragm is lowered due to contraction intercostals muscle. This result into the increase of volume of thorax causing fall of air pressure in the thoracic cavity lowers the pressure in the lungs and the air rushes from outside into lungs through external nares, trachea & bronchi. During expiration the diaphragm move upward and the lateral thoracic walls move inwards due to the relaxation of muscles of diaphragm and the intercoastals muscles. This decrease the volume of thorax and the pressure inside the thorax and lungs is increased which results in the expulsion of some of air from the lungs to the atmosphere outside the body. 5.Define oxygen dissociation curve? Why it has sigmoidal pattern? Ans. The relationship between O 2 tension and its absorption by haemoglobin produces a graph called oxygen dissociation curve (O 2 equilibrium curve). At about 100 mm Hg O 2 8 ","tension Hb is 98% saturated (complete formation of haemoglobin). As it falls, the saturation of Hb decreases slowly. When O 2 tension is about 40mm Hg, oxyhaemoglobin dissociates and O 2 is available to the tissues.

The following are the main respiratory organs:-1) Nostrils – These are the paired openings situated at the anterior and posterior ends of the nasal chambers. They are lined up with ciliated epithelium and mucous cells. These prevent the entrance of dust into lungs and help in warming and moistening the air. The nasal chamber opens interiorly by external nostril and posterior internal nostril into the pharynx. 2) Larynx – It is situated at the anterior part of trachea and communicates with the pharynx. The glottis is protected by a stiff cartilage called epiglottis. The larynx contains pairs of vocal cords which set into vibrations when the air enters into it and produces the sound. 3) Trachea – It is a long ringed tube. It is supported c – shaped elastic cartilaginou rings to prevent its collapsing. It is lined internally with mucous membrane to hold the dust particles, 11 ","bacteria and other foreign bodies. It also warms the air. 4) Bronchi – Inside the thorax, the trachea bifurcates into two branchy and each of which enters into one lung. In each lung, the bronchus again redivides into numerous small branches known as bronchioles. These bronchioles further divide at its ends to form respiratory bronchioles. 5) Lungs – There are two large bag-like spongy structures which are the main respiratory organs. These are enclosed by double pleural membranes. The lungs are divided externally by lobes. The right lung consists of four lobes and left by two lobes. Inside the lungs, the respiratory bronchioles give rise to alveolar ducts, alveolar sac and finally alveoli. Each lung contains millions of alveoli. Each alveolus is exceptionally thin walled. Its walls are highly permeable and richly supplied with blood capillaries. The blood is supplied to the lungs by a pair of pulmonary arteries. These bring blood which poor in oxygen & rich in CO 2 . The exchange of gases occurs in the alveoli of the lungs. The oxygenated blood from alveolar capillaries is called by pair of pulmonary vein to be conveyed to the heart. 3. Explain how our heart muscles get a continuous supply of atmospheric oxygen. Ans. When inspiration occurs, the O 2 is taken into lungs. O 2 mixes with air already present in alveoli and becomes alveolar air, whose PO 2 is 100 m Hg. As PO 2 of blood in the vessels is 40 mmHg oxygen differs into blood vessels from alveoli and the oxyhaemoglobin is formed when oxygen combines loosely with the Fe ++ ions of haemoglobin. Oxygenated blood from the lungs reaches the left auricle through pulmonary vein; to left ventricle is pumped at through aorta also. The branch supplying blood to heart muscles is coronary artery. In heart muscles, as the PO 2 is lower than that of the blood in the branches of coronary artery, oxyhaemoglobin dissociates and releases O 2 to cardiac muscles. 12 ","CBSE Class 11 Biology Important Questions Chapter 18 Body Fluids and Circulation 1 Marks Questions 1.Which of the four chambers of the human heart has the thickest muscular wa ll?

It wondered what would become of it because it was getting cold and since there was nothing to eat, it would starve and die. 2: (i) Find in the poem the lines that mean the same as Neither a borrower nor a lender be (Shakespeare). (ii) What is your opinion of the ant’s principles? Ans: (i) The lines in the poem that mean the same as “Neither a borrower nor a lender be” are 'But we ants never borrow; we ants never lend.' (ii) I agree with what the ant says first that one should save something for the future so that he does not need to borrow or lend. But I don’t agree with the ant’s principle what he told later. If he says he is a friend of cricket then he should also help the cricket at the time of distress. On the other hand I believe that a friend in need is a friend indeed. 3: Ans: The ant told the cricket to “dance the winter away” because when it asked the cricket what it did in the summers and why it had not stored any food for summers, the cricket Answered that it sang through the warm and sunny months of summers. Therefore, in reply to this, the ant asked the cricket to “dance” the winter away just like 8 ","it “sang” all through the summers and did not bother to store food for winters. 4: (i) Which lines in the poem express the poet's comment?

Ans. The heart is a muscular organ situated in thoracic cavity which lies above the diaphragm between the two lungs. It is situated almost in the middle of the chest tilted at its apex to the left. It is enclosed in a double walled membranous sac, the pericardium fitted with pericardial fluid. The heart continuous working without stopping throughout the life of an individual. The heart of an average person at rest under normal circumstances beats. 70 to 80 times in a minute when it contracts its forces and pumps the blood into arteries which supply the blood to body organs. In man and other mammals heart is four chambered structure divisible into two halves right and left. The right & left halves of the heart are completely separated by septa. Each half has an upper chamber called the auricle and the lower chamber called the ventricle. Each auricle opens into the ventricle of its one side through an auricuo–ventricular aperature. The two apertures are guarded by valves which open only into the ventricle and prevent the back flow of the blood. The mitral valve or bicuspid valve having two flaps is present at the AV opening on the left side and the tricuspid valve (with three flaps) on the right side of the heart. The left ventricle is provided with tendinous cords called chordae tendinae and papillary muscle which prevent the valves from being pushed into auricles when the ventricles contract. The starting point of the aorta at left ventricle there is another set of semilunar valves. 13 ","2. What is lymphatic system? Discuss its importance. Ans. Lymph is a colourlese tissue fluid resembling the blood except that it has no haemoglobin and RBCs. In comparison to blood, lymph contains less blood proteins, more of waste matter, increased amount of food material and a large number of WBC’s The tissue fluid is filtered from the blood plasma through the walls of capillaries some WBC also come out from there capillaries Now this tissue fluid enters into lymphatic capillaries as is known as lymph so the tissue fluid is converted into lymph. Circulation of lymph: Lymph vessels : Almost all of the body organs have a large number of lymph vessels and lymph capillaries. The walls of lymph vessels have valves (like veins). They form the network in the organs – one is superficial and other is deep seated. The flow of lymph in these vessels is only one side i.e., from the organs but never to the organs. In human body the following two large lymph vessels are present. Ductus Thoracious – It start from the abdominal cavity with a dilation called receptaculum chyli. Then it passes into the thoracic cavity then to the left of the neck region. It receives the lymph from the following organs – lower extremities, region of the true pelvis, abdominal 14 ","region, left upper extremities the left half of the thorax, head, face & neck. Lymph nodes – These are small globular masses of lymphatic tissue and these arranged in groups from each region organs of the body the lymph flows into definite lymph nodes. The nodes are called regional nodes. Function of lymph: (i) It serves to return interstitial fluid into blood. (ii) It allows plasma proteins macromoleclues to diffuse through the lymph vessels. (iii) It transport digested fat through lacteals in villi of intestine. 3. Explain double circulation with the help of diagram. Ans. The heart is the pumping organ. It pumps blood to the various body organs, through closed vessels. Form the left ventricle blood goes with aorta which send it to arteries for supplying the body organs. From the body tissues blood is returned to the right atrium through two veins superior and inferior vena cava. This type of circulation is known as systemic circulation. From the right ventricle blood is pumped into the pulmonary trunk which divides into the pulmonary arteries each of which goes to the lung. Here the blood is oxygenated. The oxygenated blood is returned to left atrium through pulmonary veins. This is called pulmonary circulation. 15 ","16 ","CBSE Class 11 Biology Important Questions Chapter 19 Excretory Products and their Elimination 1 Marks Questions 1.In which part of nephron filtration takes place?

Two intrinsic mechanisms that provide autoregulation, Myogenic mechanism and Juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA) JGA – A special cellular apparatus is located in kidney where DCT passes close to Bowman’s capsule between afferent and efferent arterioles. The JGA cells secrete rennin that modulate blood pressure there by regulating renal flow and GFR. 3.How is the permeability of the distal convoluted tubule and the collecting tubule controlled for regulating the water content inside the body? Ans. 1) When the water content inside the body is low, the osmorecepters stimulates theadenohypophysis to releases vasopressin / ADH. 4 ","2) Vasopressin / ADH render the DCT and collecting tubule permeable to water. So, water is reabsorbed. 3) When the water content in the body is normal, there is no release of ADH. 4) The tubule is impermeable to water and water is eliminated in the urine. 4.Kidneys do not play a major role in excretion in ammonotelic animals Justify. Ans. Kidneys do not play any significant role in elimination of ammonia – (i) Ammonia is readily soluble in water and diffuses across the body surfaces. (ii) Ammonia is excreted as ammonium ions through gill surface. 5.Define glomerular filtration rate. What is its value in a healthy human? Ans.

What suggestion would you offer for the removal of waste products from the blood in such a situation. Ans. It is because, the blood to pass through the glomerulus of the nephron must have required amount of pressure in it. If the pressure is not sufficient it will not flow through glomerulus and filtration would not the take place, hence no urine would be formed. This is quite harmful to the person as waste products go on accumulating in the body. To avoid this, a person should be advised take sufficient amount of water and medicine to keep the blood pressure at optimum level. 2.Explain briefly how micturation is a reflex process; but is also under some voluntary control. Ans. 1) Micturation is act of voiding urine 2) It accomplished by the simultaneous contraction of the smooth muscles of urinary bladder wall and the relaxation of the skeletal muscle sphincters around the opening of the bladder. 3) As the bladder wall becomes stretched due to accumulation of urine, the stretch receptors in the wall of the bladder generate nerve impulse that are carried to sense neurons to the spinal cord and brain produce the sensation of fullness. 4) But the sphincter muscles can also be relaxed voluntarily and there by the smooth muscles of the bladder are allowed to contract under autonomic control and the content of the bladder can be emptied. 3.Describe urea cycle. 7 ","Ans.

In dialysis small solute moleclues diffuse through a semi permeable membrane as a substitute for glomerulus. It has a cellophane membrane where the blood of a patient is made to flow on one side of the membrane and the surrounding fluid on other side. The wastes from the blood move into the surrounding fluid though cellophane membrane. It is needed when kidney fails to work and urine is not formed. 5.Suppose the kidneys of a person are damaged, can you predict what is going to happen to him? Ans. The kidneys are considered as master chemists of the body. If they are damaged, it would disturb the normal functioning of the life processes. Due to the effect of toxins produced by some bacteria the fillers of tiny uriniferous tubules are damaged. They become perforated with larger holes and allow blood cells, proteins also to pass through them along with the urea and water during filtration of blood in formation of urine. Thus urine contains the blood proteins etc. It is a serious disease. 8 ","6. How does liver both as a digestive as well as an excretory organ? Ans.

(----any three) 9 ","CBSE Class 12 Biology Important Questions Chapter 19 Excretory Products and their Elimination 5 Marks Questions 1. Describe briefly the structure and function of renal corpuscle. Ans. Renal Corpuscle – It is the main excretory organ in the kidney. Nephrons are the functional units of kidney of renal corpuscle. There are about 102 million nephrons in each kidney in man. Structure of nephron – The nephron is a thin, long, twisted tubular structure. The tubule of each nephron starts as a up – shaped called Bowman’s capsule. There is a globular tuft of capillaries in the hollow of the cup. The Bowman’s capsule and the glomerulus together form a globular body called the renal corpuscle. Blood enters the glomerular capillaries through an afferent arteriole and leaves the glomerulus through as efferent arteriole. Urine is formed by the filtration of a protein free fluid from the glomerulus into lumen of the Bowman’s capsule. There are 3 parts of a nephron – (i) proximal nephron (ii) hoop of Henle and (iii) distal nephron. A long highly coiled and tubule trusted starts form the neck of the Bowman’s capsule. It is called the PCT (Proximal Convoluted tubule). It continues into a thin–walled straight tubule, then loops like segment of the tubule is called the Henle’s loop. It has thin descending limb and thick ascending limb. The Henle’s loop continuous into another segment of coiled and twisted tubule called DCT (Distal convoluted tubule). The terminal part of DCT is a straight short tubule called the collecting duct. The collecting duct runs down to the medulla again 10 ","conducting the collected urine towards the medulla. The collecting ducts unite with each other in the medulla to form the larger ducts called Ducts of Bellini. These ducts rue through the renal pyramids and open into renal pelvis. The efferent arteriole gives a capillary network around the tubule in the cortex. It also fives rise to some parallel wise, thin walled straight capillaries called vasa rectae. They help to maintain reabsorbed ions and urea in the intestinal fluid and maintain osmotic pressure in the kidney. Functions – Various part of nephron perform deferent function but the main function is liberation of metabolic waste from the body and maintain osmotic pressure of fluid in the body. 2. Describe the mechanism of urine formation. 11 ","Ans. Urine formation involves three main processes – (i) Glomerular filtration – A protein – free fluid is filtered from blood of glomerular capillaries into the lumen of Bowman’s capsule. The filtration occurs through three layers,which form the filtration membrane; they are : (i) Endothelium of glomerular capillaries (ii) Epithelium of Bowman’s capsule. (iii) Basement membrane between the two layers. The epithelial cells or podocytes of the Bowman’s capsule are arranged in an intricate manner, to leave some filtration slits. The blood is filtered so finely that the composition of filtrate is very similar to plasma except for the plasma proteins. The glomerular filtrate rate is about (25ml / min) (ii) Reabsorption -Nearly 90% of the filtrate is reabsorbed in the renal tubule of the epithelial cells of the lining of renal tubule. Certain substances like glucose, amino acids, Na + ions, K + ions and Ca 2+ ions are reabsorbed actively. Water is reabsorbed passively by osmosis. Certain other substance like Cl -ions are absorbed passively. (iii) Tubular secretion – It is the process by which certain substances / ions like K+ and ammonia are directly secreted into the lumen of the nephron. The step is important in urine formation, as it helps to maintain the ionic balance and PH of the body fluids. 12 ","3. Describe the renal excretory system of man. Ans. The urinary system consist of following organs. (a) A pair of kidneys (b) A pair of ureters (c) Urinary bladder (d) Urethra kidney – The kidneys are located in the abdomen, one on each side of the vertebral column just below the diaphragm, which remains protected by last two pairs of ribs.. The left kidney is usually placed higher than right one. Each kidney is 10cm in length 5 cm in breadth and 4cm in thickness. Each kidney is somewhat bean shaped with concavity along the inner border. Blood vessels, nerves, lymph ducts and ureters enter the kidney at this point. In the gross anatomy of kidney, two regions can be clearly marked out. There are outer cortex and inner medulla. Internal structure of kidney – Each kidney composed of several tiny units called nephrons or uriniferous tubule, all similar in structure and function. Each nephron is made up of 13 ","vascular component, the glomerulus and tubular component, and surrounded by a network of capillaries. The tubule is composed of single layer of epithelial cells which differ in structure and function in different parts of the tubule. The tubule originates as a blind sac, which is known as Bowman’s capsule which is lined by a single layer of thin epithelial cells – Bowman’s capsule is ultimately associated with vascular glomerulus which protrudes into Bowman’s capsule and is completely covered by the linning of the capsule. The glomerulus is formed by afferent and efferent arteries. The afferent arterioles bring blood to the tubular and efferent arterioles takes blood away from the tubule. Due to this, the blood in the glomerulus is separated from the space within the capsule only by (a) a thin layer of a tissue composed of the single – celled capillary lining (b) a layer material called basement membrane and (c) the single celled lining of Bowman’s capsule. This extremely thin barrier permits the filtration of the fluid from the capillaries into Bowman’s capsule. The glomerular capillaries combine together to form efferent arterioles which further divide into many capillaries distributed all over the surface of the tubule. These capillaries are termed as particular capillaries. These capillaries join together to form the venous channels which take blood away from the kidney. The tubule is divided into three pates – Proximal convoluted part in which Bowman’s capsule opens. The next part is Henle’s loop and last part is distal convoluted part which finally runs as a collecting duct. Ureters – These are two tubes or about 30 cm long – one coming out from each kidney. They run downwards and open into urinary bladder. Urinary bladder- It is a bag like structure where urine is stared. The bladder has three openings two of the ureters and one to urethra. Urethra – the urethra is the passage through which urine is passed out. 14 ","15 ","CBSE Class 11 Biology Important Questions Chapter 20 Locomotion and Movement 1 Marks Questions 1.Name the functional contractile unit of muscle.

And an extension for that point. During flexion at the elbow biceps contracts and triceps relaxes; during extension triceps contracts and biceps relaxes. b) Tetnus – If a muscle fiber is stimulated by many nerve impulses or electric shocks it will remain in the state of contraction till the stimulation continued of contraction is known as tetnus. c) Threshold stimulus – Each skeletal muscle is made of many muscle fibers and each muscle fiber is supplied by a nerve. These nerves sends nerve impulse to the muscle fibers. As a result of this the muscle is stimulated and contraction of the muscle takes place. But for contraction muscle fibres requires a minimum strength of the nerve impulse. This is called threshold stimulus. 9 ","CBSE Class 12 Biology Important Questions Chapter 20 Locomotion and Movement 5 Marks Questions 1.What is the role of Ca ++ and ATP in muscle contraction? Ans. A nerve impulse arriving at neuromuscular junction stimulates contractile response. Due to the depolarization of the surface of sarcomeres it spreads quickly. Neurotransmitter is releases at the enormous collar junction. It enters into the sarcomere through membrane channel. Na + moves inside the sarcomere. It is called inflow of Na + . Action potential is generated in the sarcomere. Action potential travels to the full length of muscle fiber. The sarcoplasmic reticulum, then release the Ca 2+ which is stored here. It binds to the specific sites found in the hooping of the thin filament. Their filaments are called actins, change fakes in troponing active sites of F – actin are exposed then to myosin head. Myosin head shows Mg 2+ dependent ATPase activity. During relaxation of muscle Ca 2+ is pumped back into sarcoplasmic reticulum. Consequently the troponing component is treed to inhibit the active sites for myosin head. Cross bridges are broken. Their filaments assume their normal position. The muscle fiber is then in relaxed state. 10 ","2. Describe the various kinds of joint in human body. According to mobility giving one example of each. Ans. Various types of joints – When two or more bones articular with each other at a particular point it forms a joint. The joints help in performing various types of movements. In the body of vertebrates three types of joints are found – 1) Perfect joints – The joints have synovial joints are capable of performing movements in more than one plane. These joints may be of the following categories-(a) Ball and socket joints – As the name suggests in this type of joint one bone forms a cup like depression of socket in which ball like structure fits. The head or ball can move freely can the joint in any direction. Ex – shoulder and hip joints. (b) Hinge joint – In this type of joint movement is performed only in one direction. Ex elbow, knee joint, joints of phalanges of fingers & toes. (c) Gliding joints – such are the joints in which one surface glides over another such joints are found in the vertebral column. 11 ","(d) Pivot joint – One bones of the joint is always fixed and other is able to move freely over the former. Such joints can be seen in the skull of man which moves freely over the adontoid process the 2 nd neck vertebra. (e) Saddle joints : It resembles ball & socket joint except that ball and socket are not fully developed. 2) Imperfect joint – the joints which do not possesses synovial capsule or connecting ligaments are called imperfect joints. Ex – the joint between the ilium of pelvic girdle and transverse process by sacral vertebra. 3) Immovable joints:- Joints which are permanently fixed and cannot perform any movement are termed as immovable joints, these also do not posses synovial capsule of ligaments. Various bones of the skull are joined with such joints. These joints do not allow any kind of movements. 3. Explain sliding filament theory of muscle contraction. Ans. Sarcomeres are small units of myofibrils: the sarcomere consists of A – band in the centre with halves of two I – bands on its two sides i. e. the distance between two z – membranes. When stimulus is given to muscles, the thin (actin or I – band) filaments slide in the space between the thick (myosin or A – bond) but neither of them change its length. Due to sliding of I filaments, there is breakage and rearrangement of the cross – linkage between actin and myosin filaments. The ATP is broken by the enzyme ATPase myosin which provides energy for interaction between actin and myosin filaments. Consequently, the thin action filaments slide deeper into the A bands and z – lines are drawn closer with each other by the disappearance of H – zone finally the sarcomeres becomes shortened due to shortening of its I–band. By relaxation, the cross linkage between the filaments are rearranged. The cross–bridges disappear due to the pulling of the filaments by the active sites on the actin filaments. The actin filaments are slide out from the A – band. Consequently, this elongates I – band, pushing the z – line away form each other. Thus contrition and relaxation of muscles occurs due to repetitive formation and breakage of cross bridges between thick filament of A – band and thin filament of I–band. 12 ","13 ","CBSE Class 11 Biology Important Questions Chapter 21 Neural Control and Coordination 1 Marks Questions 1.
